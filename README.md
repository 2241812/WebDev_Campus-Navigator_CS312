# 🧭 Bravo's Compass — Animated Welcome Screen | Draft of a Campus Navigation System

Welcome to **Bravo's Compass!**  
This is a dynamic and visually engaging **welcome screen** for a web application, designed to create a memorable first impression for users.  

The screen features an **animated mascot, "Bravo,"** who guides the user into the main application through a unique **zoom-in-to-compass transition.**

> ⚡ A portion of the web development phase was *vibe coded* — to streamline development, and the transition to this kind of power.

## ✨ Features

- **Idle Animation:**  
  Bravo has a subtle, looping “breathing” animation to make the page feel alive.  

- **Interactive Hover Effect:**  
  When the user hovers over the compass on Bravo’s collar, the mascot scales up slightly with a golden glow, indicating interactivity.  

- **Immersive Zoom Transition:**  
  Clicking the compass triggers a full-screen zoom focused on the compass, transitioning the background to a warm gold before revealing the loading screen.  

- **Pure Front-End:**  
  Self-contained in a single `index.html` file — no frameworks or complex dependencies required.
